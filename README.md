## How to Use This Repository 🧭

1.  **Browse the Problems:**  Start exploring the problems, organized by topic or difficulty level (you'll likely want to create directories to organize the problems).
2.  **Understand the Question:**  Read the problem statement carefully.  Make sure you understand the input, output, constraints, and any edge cases.
3.  **Study the Solution:**  Examine the provided solution code.  Focus on understanding the algorithm and the data structures used.
4.  **Read the Explanation:**  Dive into the detailed explanation.  Make sure you understand *why* the solution works and its time/space complexity.
5.  **Practice!**  Try to solve the problem yourself *before* looking at the solution.  This is the most effective way to learn.  Implement the solution in your preferred language (Python is provided, but consider adding solutions in other languages).
6.  **Test Your Code:**  Thoroughly test your implementation with various inputs, including edge cases and large datasets.
